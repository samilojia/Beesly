Beesly respects your privacy and does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data. The app works entirely on your device and does not require account creation, sign-in, or network communication. All generated color palettes and settings are stored locally on your Mac and are used only to provide the app’s functionality. Beesly does not use analytics, advertising frameworks, tracking technologies, or third-party services. When you choose to copy a color value, the app places that value on the system clipboard only at your request and does not access clipboard contents otherwise. Because all data remains on your device, your information stays fully under your control.
